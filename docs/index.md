## What is erln8?

erln8 v2 contains several tools that let a developer set custom versions of Erlang, Elixir, Rebar, and Rebar3 per directory. This allows you to "set and forget" versions of your tools for a project once.

erln8 v2 ships with 3 binaries:

- `erln8` - An Erlang version manager, completely rewritten from the ground up.
- `extract` - An Elixir version manager.
- `reo` - Rebar version manager, uses the same core code that erln8 uses.
- `reo3` - Same as reo, but for Rebar3.

## FAQ

- Does erln8 support MS Windows?
	- I don't own Windows, but if you want to submit PR's to support it and build precompiled binaries, I'll all for it.

- What language is it written in?
	- D, it's super fast, easy, and it's not C++ or C.

- Why isn't it written in Erlang?
	- chicken and egg, I never assumed you'd have Erlang built to be used by a tool that builds Erlang.

- What does reo mean?
	- Australian [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar) for "rebar"
