# erln8 v2

ernl8 v2 contains several tools that let a developer set custom versions of Erlang, Rebar, and Rebar3 per directory. This allows you to "set and forget" versions of your tools for a project once.

erln8 v2 ships with 3 binaries:

- `erln8` - Erlang version manager, completely rewritten from the ground up.
- `reo` - Rebar version manager, uses the same core code that erln8 uses.
- `reo3` - Same as reo, but for Rebar3.


## Quickstart

#### NOTE

***Currently, erln8 won't generate the correct symlinks if you already have an `~/.erln8.d` from an older version. Move it out of the way before continuing.***

### OSX

Build and install:

```
brew upgrade
brew install dmd dub
  # You MUST use DMD 2.076.1 or above
git clone https://github.com/erln8/reo.git
cd reo
make
make install

# erln8, reo, and reo3 are all installed in the local user home
# at ~/.erln8.d/bin
# YOU MUST ADD ~/.erln8.d/bin TO YOUR PATH!
```

### Ubuntu 15.04

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev openssl libssl-dev fop xsltproc unixodbc-dev libglib2.0-dev git autoconf
sudo apt-get install xdg-utils

wget http://downloads.dlang.org/releases/2.x/2.067.1/dmd_2.067.1-0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i dmd_2.067.1-0_amd64.deb

wget http://code.dlang.org/files/dub-0.9.23-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xvzf dub-0.9.23-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv dub /usr/local/bin/dub

git clone https://github.com/erln8/reo.git
cd reo
make
make install

# erln8, reo, and reo3 are all installed in the local user home
# at ~/.erln8.d/bin
# YOU MUST ADD ~/.erln8.d/bin TO YOUR PATH!
```

### Centos

```
sudo yum install gcc glibc-devel make ncurses-devel openssl-devel autoconf git

wget http://downloads.dlang.org/releases/2.x/2.067.1/dmd-2.067.1-0.fedora.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install dmd-2.067.1-0.fedora.x86_64.rpm

wget http://code.dlang.org/files/dub-0.9.23-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install dub-0.9.23-1.x86_64.rpm


git clone https://github.com/erln8/reo.git
cd reo
make
make install

# erln8, reo, and reo3 are all installed in the local user home
# at ~/.erln8.d/bin
# YOU MUST ADD ~/.erln8.d/bin TO YOUR PATH!
```
## Build the latest tagged version of Erlang

To build the latest tagged version of Erlang from the OTP Git repo:

```
erln8 --build-latest
```

or pick a different version:

```
# pick a version from
erln8 --buildable
# and then build it
erln8 --build OTP_R16B03-1
```

You can also build multiple versions with one command:

```
erln8 --build OTP_R16B03-1 --build OTP-17.0 --build OTP-18.0
```


## Setting a version of Erlang, Rebar or Rebar3 in the current direcory

```
erln8 --use OTP_R16B03-1
# or if you've already set a version of Erlang in the CWD:
erln8 --use OTP_R16B03-1 --force
```

```
reo --use foo
# or if you've already set a version of Rebar in the CWD:
reo --use foo --force
```

```
reo3 --use foo
# or if you've already set a version of Rebar3 in the CWD:
reo3 --use foo --force
```

## How it works

When an Erlang, Rebar, or Rebar3 command is issued in the shell, erln8/reo/reo3 fulfill the request by searching the current working directory for an `erln8.config` file. If the CWD doesn't contain this file, then continue up the directory tree searching for one, and then stop at `/`. If an `erln8.config` file can't be found, erln8/reo/reo3 will use a `system_default`. 

## Configuration

| Path  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `~/.erln8.d`  | Erln8/Reo/Reo3 config home  |
| `~/.erln8.d/bin`  |  Binary directory, contains erln8, reo, reo3 and symlinks to all Erlang, Rebar, Rebar3 executables |
| `~/.erln8.d/otps`  | erln8 managed versions of Erlang |
| `~/.erln8.d/repos`  | erln8 Git repos to build Erlang from source  |
| | |

## FAQ

- What language is it written in?
	- D, it's super fast, easy, and it's not C++ or C.

- Why isn't it written in Erlang?	
	- chicken and egg, I never assumed you'd have Erlang built to be used by a tool that builds Erlang.

- No really, why not \<language X\>?
	- Erlang is slow for command line tools, I wanted a tool that could be used in a command line prompt.
	- I played around with implementing erln8 in the following, all of which weren't a great fit:
		- C++
		- Racket
		- Haskell
		- OCaml
		- Rust
		- Go

- But D is weird!
	- so are kitten elbows
	
- What does reo mean?
	- Australian slang for "rebar"

- Does erln8 support MS Windows?
	- I don't own Windows, but if you want to submit PR's to support it and build precompiled binaries, I'll all for it.

- Do you sing at parties?
	-  No, not really.
